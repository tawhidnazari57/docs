## About enabling delegated bypass for push protection

{% data reusables.secret-scanning.push-protection-delegate-bypass-beta-note %}

{% data reusables.secret-scanning.push-protection-delegated-bypass-intro %} For more information, see "[AUTOTITLE](/code-security/secret-scanning/using-advanced-secret-scanning-and-push-protection-features/delegated-bypass-for-push-protection/about-delegated-bypass-for-push-protection)."

When you enable this feature, you will create a bypass list of roles and teams who can manage requests to bypass push protection. If you don't already have appropriate teams or roles to use, you should create additional teams before you start.

>[!NOTE] You can't add secret teams to the bypass list.

{% ifversion push-protection-bypass-fine-grained-permissions %}Alternatively, you can grant specific organization members the ability to review and manage bypass requests using fine-grained permissions, which give you more refined control over which individuals and teams can approve and deny bypass requests. For more information, see "[Using fine-grained permissions to control who can review and manage bypass requests](#using-fine-grained-permissions-to-control-who-can-review-and-manage-bypass-requests)."{% endif %}

## Using fine-grained permissions to control who can review and manage bypass requests

You can grant specific individuals or teams the ability to review and manage bypass requests using fine-grained permissions.

1. Ensure that delegated bypass is enabled for the organization. For more information, follow steps 1-5 in "[Configuring delegated bypass for your organization](/code-security/secret-scanning/using-advanced-secret-scanning-and-push-protection-features/delegated-bypass-for-push-protection/enabling-delegated-bypass-for-push-protection#configuring-delegated-bypass-for-an-organization)."
1. Create (or edit) a custom organization role. For information on creating and editing custom roles, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-custom-organization-roles#creating-a-custom-role)."
1. When choosing which permissions to add to the custom role, select the "Review and manage {% data variables.product.prodname_secret_scanning %} bypass requests" permission.
1. Assign the custom role to individual members or teams in your organization. For more information on assigning custom roles, see "[AUTOTITLE](/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/using-organization-roles#assigning-an-organization-role)."
